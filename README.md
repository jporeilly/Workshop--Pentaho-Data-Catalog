sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates
sudo cp local-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
sudo update-ca-certificates

sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/lib/security/cacerts -alias hcp1-pentaho -file hcp1-pentaho.crt \
Warning: use -cacerts option to access cacerts keystore \
Enter keystore password:   \
Certificate already exists in keystore under alias <mycert> \
Do you still want to add it? [no]:  yes \
Certificate was added to keystore \


The CA trust store location
The CA trust store (as generated by update-ca-certificates) is available at the following locations:

As a single file (PEM bundle) in /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt \
As an OpenSSL-compatible certificate directory in /etc/ssl/certs \
